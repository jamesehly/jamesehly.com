#### About

I consider myself an lifelong learner and enjoy reading about and learning new
front-end technologies. I simply enjoy creating things that work well, and the
web is an excellent platform for that passion. In my spare time I've been creating
JavaScript layout systems using typescript, a checkbook app using Angular 2 and
Firebase, and I like to dabble in things like Electron, React, Vue and other new JS
libraries. JavaScript is definitely my language of choice, especially when coupled
with TypeScript (C# would be a close second).
