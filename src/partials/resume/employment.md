### Senior Software Developer
#### Sycorr, Inc. • Jan 2013-Present
At Sycorr I lead front-end web development strategies as a full stack web developer
on ASP.NET enterprise systems for banks and other financial institutions. I also
serve as principle web designer and user experience expert. We utilize various
technologies including .NET MVC5 Framework, C#, JavaScript, MS SQL, HTML5/
CSS3, Angular JS, GIT, PHP, WordPress, etc.

My main responsibility has been to coordinate our front-end stack with our backend
development. This has resulted in a custom framework that includes an
Angular JS layout and menu system, a JavaScript/jQuery API that works well with
C# and the .NET framework to handle ajax requests and data table layouts, and
other custom JavaScript modules. My front-end work has allowed the company to
rapidly develop enterprise applications using the framework tools I created.

Projects I've worked on include identity auditing software, a custom CRM software
solution for an insurance agency, loan management software, back-end system for
a Native American nation's Dept. of Transportation and Dept. of Equal Opportunity,
creating a system of object oriented theme and plugin classes for WordPress,
authoring many WordPress plugins and themes, developing a proprietary system
to auto update WordPress themes and plugins using Amazon Web Services, and
working with programmers to create front-ends for websites using Razor templates,
Angular JS, and a custom front-end framework.
